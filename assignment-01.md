* **Pentamaster** focuses on automation manufacturing and technology solutions provider while **Vitrox** focuses on design and manufacture of vision inspection equipment and embedded electronics devices. Both are **future-proof** in ways that they will not be phased out easily; and should it be phased out, they can rcontinue on with other similiar sectors.

* In 5 year period:
  * ViTrox's stocks increases from RM1.12 to RM7.25 up to **550%** increase in value.
  * Pentamaster's stocks increases from RM0.48 to RM3.60 up to **650%** increase in value.

* Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Malaysian political crisis, there are quite a few drops of stock value for both in the short term. In our case since investment is for long term it shouldn't be much of a problem.

* Comparing both compnay using Annual Report in 2020:
  * The earnings per share of ViTrox is **22.40sen** and **9.95sen** for Pentamaster.
  * The cash ratio (cash/liabilities) for Vitrox is **1.67** and for Pentamaster is **3.69**. Pentamaster have more cash to cover their debts in the short term.
  * The net income growth of ViTrox and Pentamaster is **32.60%** and **-14.64%** respectively. It should be noted that ViTrox's growth fell for 24.49% in the year 2019.
  * The P/E ratio of ViTrox and Pentamaster is **65.42** and **76.79** respectively. Both of them are quite similiar in value.

* As of 19/3/2022, the share price of ViTrox and Pentamaster is **RM7.25** and **RM3.60** respectively.

* In conclusion, both of them have similiar values in terms of their business sectors, financial situation and more. But most notably Pentamaster's are traded at a cheaper valuation with better cash ratio and long term growth. I would choose **Pentamaster** as my primary stock but it's better to diversify (preferably other sectors) and invests in suitable proportions to minimize risks.
